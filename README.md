# Light Pollution Monitoring App

The purpose of this project is to provide an interactive and real-time representation of light pollution levels across different urban locations. 
By collecting data from ambient light sensors and integrating external datasets such as weather conditions and population density, the app allows users to analyze and visualize light pollution trends effectively.

Developed using Android (Kotlin) with Firebase Realtime Database, and integrated with  MPAndroidChart for live dynamic graph and map visualisations.
